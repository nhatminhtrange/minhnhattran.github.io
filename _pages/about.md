👋 Hi! I'm **Minh Nhat Tran**,  
Ph.D. Candidate in Civil and Geosystems Engineering at XYZ University.

---

### 🎯 Research Interests
- Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) for near-surface site characterization  
- Seismic wave propagation modeling (SH, Love, and Rayleigh waves)  
- Geotechnical site investigation using seismic methods  
- Machine learning applications in geophysics  

---

### 🧠 Current Research
My current work focuses on developing time-domain FWI algorithms for SH- and Love-wave inversion in near-surface geotechnical applications.  
I’m especially interested in improving resolution in delaminated and reinforced concrete structures.
